# Mancala Game (Player vs. Computer)

A classic Mancala board game implemented in HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. Play against a simple computer opponent!

## Description

This project brings the ancient game of Mancala to your web browser. It features a clean, modern interface and implements the standard rules, including captures and extra turns. The current version allows a human player (Player 1) to compete against a basic AI (Computer/Player 2).

## Features

* **Classic Mancala Gameplay:** Implements standard sowing, capture, and extra turn rules.
* **Player vs. Computer:** Play against a built-in AI opponent.
* **Modern UI:** Clean and responsive interface styled with Tailwind CSS.
* **Clear Turn Indication:** Easily see whose turn it is.
* **Game Over Detection:** Automatically detects the end of the game and declares the winner.
* **Reset Functionality:** Start a new game at any time.

## How to Play

1.  **Objective:** Collect more stones in your Mancala store (the large pit on your right) than your opponent.
2.  **Your Turn:** Click on one of the six pits on your side (bottom row) that contains stones.
3.  **Sowing:** The stones from the chosen pit are distributed one by one into the subsequent pits counter-clockwise, including your Mancala store but skipping the opponent's store.
4.  **Extra Turn:** If the last stone you sow lands in your own Mancala store, you get another turn.
5.  **Capture:** If the last stone you sow lands in an *empty* pit on your side, and the opponent's pit directly across from it contains stones, you capture both your last stone and all the stones from the opponent's opposite pit. These captured stones go directly into your Mancala store.
6.  **Game End:** The game ends when all six pits on one player's side are empty. The player whose side still has stones captures all of them into their Mancala store.
7.  **Winner:** The player with the most stones in their Mancala store at the end wins.
